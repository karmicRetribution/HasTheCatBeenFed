Gonna try to put this together here on GitHub as much as possible. Uploaded the inital cat image, created by Dall-E with some editing to clean it up. Also made a version without the cat. 

Used my Nepeta cat head for the app icons. Spun up the create-react-app and swapped that in.

What do I want here?
  * If current device is not registered, front page should be "Has the cat been fed?" and 2 selections: "Create new household" OR "Enter household number"
  * If New Household, then provide newly-generated household number and warning to screenshot and save the number since no email is taken
  
  * Signed in front page: "The cat was last fed <time, date>"
    * below that: a button saying "I just fed the cat"
    * Below that, little house icon and the household number, with options button
  * Options: Create new household, Change household
